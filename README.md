# Overview

I created this small "Hello World" program as a first step toward building and publishing software more professionally. My goal with this project was to test my development environment, practice using GitHub, and follow standard documentation practices. Even though this is a very simple program, it is the beginning of a portfolio that will grow over the semester.

This software runs a basic script that prints a welcome message to the screen. It represents the initial setup for future work in mobile development and other programming modules I will complete.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE because of its flexibility and built-in tools for software development.  
Git was used for version control and to publish my project to a public GitHub repository.

Programming Language: Python  
(I selected Python because it runs easily on any computer and allows me to complete this first milestone quickly.)
